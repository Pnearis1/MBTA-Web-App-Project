# MBTA-Web-App-Project
# Project Over view 
The MBTA Web App is a simple website that helps users find the closest MBTA station by entering a location. It uses the Mapbox API to turn the location into coordinates and the MBTA API to find the nearest stop and check if it's wheelchair accessible. The app is built with Flask and has a clean user interface where users can enter a place and get useful results. As an extra feature, it can also show the current weather at the location using the OpenWeatherMap API.

# Reflection 
Building the MBTA Web App was a valuable experience in combining multiple components of web development and API integration into a cohesive project. The process of connecting to APIs like Mapbox and MBTA helped solidify our understanding of how structured data (like JSON) can be used to power dynamic web apps. Developing with Flask was relatively smooth and enjoyable, and it provided a clear structure for routing, handling user input, and rendering templates. One challenge was dealing with edge cases—such as when users input addresses with no nearby MBTA stations—which required us to build in error handling and improve the user experience. Overall, separating logic into mbta_helper.py and using environment variables for API keys made the app cleaner and more secure.

From a learning perspective, I gained a lot from figuring out how to connect APIs to a working web app. One of the biggest challenges was understanding how to correctly format API requests and parse the responses, especially since different APIs return data in slightly different ways. It took some trial and error to get the Mapbox and MBTA APIs to return the right information and to extract the coordinates and station details I needed. Another challenge was designing the app to respond correctly to user input—making sure it handled errors gracefully when users typed in vague or invalid locations. I also had to think about how to display the results clearly and guide the user back if something went wrong. This project really helped me improve my problem-solving skills, and it gave me more confidence in working with real-world APIs and creating interactive web applications.

I did not have a partner which added to the challenges when creating this program. I do think that it would have been helpful to have another opinion and par of hands to complete this. However This project pushed me to be resourceful and figure out these obsticles.
